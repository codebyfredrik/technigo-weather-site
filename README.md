I have created a weather site with JavaScript, CSS and HTML.

The following features have been implemented:

- Flexbox and CSS Grids have been used to handle some parts of the responsiveness of the site
- The linear background colors change in the following intervals:

  - Medium Temp >= 10 degree C
  - Cold: Temp < 10 degree C
