# Project 6 - Weather site (Week 6)

### 1. What is this?

A weather site that displays current weather and 24-hour forecast for locations around the world.

### 2. What did I do?

This weekÂ´s project (@ Technigo Boot Camp 2019) was to create a simple weather web application that shows today's weather and temperature and a weekly forecast, using a weather API.

My version of the application includes the following additional features:

- Location search
- Location search is saved in local storage and used as default location when the user revisits the site
- 24-hour weather forecast
- Background colors change depending on current temperature

### 3. Technologies used

- HTML
- CSS
- Javascript

### 4. API's used

- OpenWeather
- Google Places

### 5. Learning objectives

- What an API is and how to use it
- Basic JSON
- How to use fetch() in Javascript
- How to use promises in JavaScript
- How to work with the Date() object in JavaScript

### 5. Where can you see it in action?
