# Project 6 - Weather site

### Summary

A weather site that displays current weather and 24-hour forecast for locations around the world.

### Implementation details

In this project I created a weather site with JavaScript, CSS and HTML.

I decided to implement the following features:

- Location search
- Location search is saved in local storage and used as default location when the user revisits the site
- Current weather
- 24-hour weather forecast (becomes visible at min-width 832px)
- 5-day weather forecast (presented with less information below min-width 832px)
- Flexbox and CSS Grids have been used to handle some parts of the responsiveness of the site.
- The linear background colors change in the following intervals:
  - Warm: Temp > 20 degree C
  - Medium Temp >= 10 degree C
  - Cold: Temp < 10 degree C

### Technologies used
